# User Classifier

This is a project that allows users to share the reason they visits sites and see why others use those sites as well.

## Getting Started

Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
